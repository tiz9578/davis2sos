# davis2sos
Upload Davis clientraw.txt to SOS 
I use these scripts to upload data from clientraw.txt to 52north SOS.
I take just some parameters, not all.
In sos1.sh just put the ip address of davis. This script call make_new_imput.sh
In make_new_input.sh in the upload section just put a valid url, user, password.
